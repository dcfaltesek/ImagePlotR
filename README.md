# ImagePlotR
A tidyverse aligned visual analysis package.

A [full tutorial](http://www.danielfaltesek.com/image_tutorial.html) is available. The purpose of this package is to put the power of image plotting in the hands of anyone who can operate in the tidyverse.


The name of this package was changed due to the abuse of the letter X by Elon Musk. The X in the context of this package was about version control, not anything else.
