\description{
Performs edge analysis
}
\details{
this function uses the same 16 cell grid for image segmentation used in the symmetry function

underlying math in this function is from a mean of canny edges detected per cell and deviation of them

the mean would speak to the total value of "ink" in the zone and the deviation may inform the character of the edges
